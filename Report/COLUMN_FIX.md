# ✅ FIXED - Column Name Issue

## 🐛 Problem
Error: "Unknown column 'amount' in 'field list'"

## 🔍 Root Cause
The financial tables use different column names:
- `offerings` table → uses `amount_collected` (not `amount`)
- `tithes` table → uses `amount` ✓
- `project_offerings` table → uses `amount_collected` (not `amount`)
- `welfare_contributions` table → uses `amount` ✓

## ✅ Solution
Updated all SQL queries in `get_executive_summary.php` to use correct column names:

### Before (Wrong):
```sql
SELECT amount FROM offerings
SELECT amount FROM project_offerings
```

### After (Correct):
```sql
SELECT amount_collected as amount FROM offerings
SELECT amount_collected as amount FROM project_offerings
```

## 📝 Changes Made
Fixed 3 queries in `get_executive_summary.php`:
1. ✅ Current month income query (line 69-76)
2. ✅ Last month income query (line 84-91)
3. ✅ 6-month financial trend query (line 244-251)

## 🧪 Test Now
Refresh the diagnose page and click "Test Fetch API" again:
```
http://localhost/Church_Management_System/admin_dashboard/Report/diagnose.php
```

Should now show:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## ✅ Expected Result
The Executive Summary should now load successfully with:
- Total Members count
- Financial data in GH₵
- Attendance metrics
- All 5 charts rendering
- No errors!

**The issue is now fixed! Refresh your Report page and the Executive Summary should work!** 🎉
