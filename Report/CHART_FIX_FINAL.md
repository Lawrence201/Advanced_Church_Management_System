# ✅ CHART ISSUE FIXED - FINAL VERSION

## 🔧 The Problem
Error: "Canvas is already in use. Chart with ID '0' must be destroyed before the canvas can be reused."

## 🎯 Root Cause
Chart.js was creating charts but not properly destroying them when the function was called again. The canvas element retained a reference to the old chart.

## ✅ Solution Applied
Used `Chart.getChart(canvas)` to get any existing chart instance from the canvas and destroy it before creating a new one.

### Before (Not Working):
```javascript
if (executiveCharts.growth) {
    executiveCharts.growth.destroy();
}
// Chart still attached to canvas!
```

### After (Working):
```javascript
// Get chart instance from canvas
const existingChart = Chart.getChart(canvas);
if (existingChart) {
    existingChart.destroy(); // Properly removes from canvas
}

// Also destroy our stored reference
if (executiveCharts.growth) {
    executiveCharts.growth.destroy();
    executiveCharts.growth = null;
}
```

## 📝 Changes Made

2. ✅ `renderFinancialChart()` - Financial Trends chart
3. ✅ `renderAttendanceChart()` - Attendance Trends chart
