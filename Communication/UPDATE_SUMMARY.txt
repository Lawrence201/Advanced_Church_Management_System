💻 TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

AUTOCOMPLETE SEARCH:
-------------------
- Searches in: Member Name, Email, Phone
- Shows: Top 10 matching results
- Displays: Member initials, name, contact info
- Prevents: Duplicate selections (shows ✓ if already selected)
- Real-time: Updates as you type


DATA FLOW:
---------
1. Page loads → Fetches all members from get_recipients.php
2. User types → Filters members in real-time (client-side)
3. User selects → Adds to selectedMembersArray
4. User clicks "Send" → Sends member IDs to send_message.php


API ENDPOINTS USED:
------------------
✅ get_recipients.php?action=members - Get all members
✅ get_recipients.php?action=departments - Get departments
✅ get_recipients.php?action=ministries - Get ministries
✅ send_message.php - Send the actual message

================================================================================
🔍 WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES
================================================================================

When you select "Others" and search for a member:

1. ALL MEMBERS are loaded into memory when page loads
   → Fast searching without hitting database every time

2. As you TYPE, JavaScript filters the list
   → Instant results (no server delay)

3. You SELECT a member
   → Member ID is stored in hidden input
   → Member appears as badge below search

4. You click "SEND NOW"
   → JavaScript collects all selected member IDs
   → Sends to send_message.php with:
     {
       audience_type: 'individual',
       member_ids: [1, 5, 10, 15]
     }

5. PHP processes the request
   → Gets member details for each ID
   → Sends email/SMS to each member
   → Returns success/failure status

================================================================================
📊 EXAMPLE API CALL (What gets sent to server)
================================================================================

    "message_type": "announcement",

    "content": "Hello! This is a test message.",
    "delivery_channels": ["email"],
    "audience_type": "others",
    "member_ids": [1, 5, 10]
}
