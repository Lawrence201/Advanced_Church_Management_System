================================================================================
🔧 HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

WHEN PAGE LOADS:
---------------
1. Calls: get_recipients.php?action=members
2. Loads all members into memory (allMembersForMessage array)
3. Ready for instant searching!


WHEN YOU TYPE:
-------------
1. JavaScript filters the member list (client-side)
2. Shows top 10 matching results
3. Displays member initials, name, and contact
4. Updates in real-time as you type


WHEN YOU SELECT:
---------------
1. Adds member to selectedMembersArray
2. Shows member as blue badge
3. Prevents selecting same member twice
4. Clears search box for next search


WHEN YOU CLICK SEND:
-------------------
1. Collects all member IDs from selectedMembersArray
2. Sends to send_message.php with:
   {
       audience_type: "others",
       member_ids: [1, 5, 10, 15]
   }
3. Backend sends message to each selected member

================================================================================
📊 DATA FORMAT
================================================================================

The get_recipients.php returns members in this format:

{
    "success": true,
    "members": [
        {
            "member_id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john@example.com",
            "phone": "+1234567890"
        },
        {
            "member_id": 2,
            "name": "Jane Smith",
            "email": "jane@example.com",
            "phone": "+0987654321"
        }
    ]
}

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

AUTOCOMPLETE NOT SHOWING:
------------------------
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors
3. Type: console.log(allMembersForMessage)
4. Should show array of members
5. If empty, check get_recipients.php

NO MEMBERS LOADING:
------------------
1. Test: http://localhost/.../Communication/get_recipients.php?action=members
2. Should return JSON with members
3. Check database has active members
4. Verify get_recipients.php exists

SEARCH NOT WORKING:
------------------
1. Make sure you typed at least 1 character
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify searchMembersForMessage() function exists
4. Type: console.log(allMembersForMessage.length)

BADGES NOT APPEARING:
--------------------
1. Check that selectedMembersDisplay div exists
2. Verify displaySelectedMembers() is called
3. Check selectedMembersList div exists
4. Open console and check for errors

DUPLICATE SELECTIONS:
--------------------
✅ Already prevented! The code checks:
   selectedMembersArray.some(m => m.member_id === id)
   
   If member already selected, shows ✓ and prevents re-selection
